# Yahoo! Fantasy Football Tools
This is just a set of tools I use to pull and analyze my Yahoo! fantasy football league's data.
Feel free to use it as you wish under the MIT License.

Thanks to the following projects:

[NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)

Apologies, but it's not at all documented, and probably shoddily designed.
